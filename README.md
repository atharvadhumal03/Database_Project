# Database_Project
The project involves the designing of a relational database system for Hyde Travel Agency.
The relational database has been created using Structured Query Language (SQL) on MySQL Workbench.

## Project Overview: 
### Case Study: Hyde Travel
#### Background on Hyde Travel: 
Hyde Travel is a medium sized travel company based in Southampton, England.
They have employed you to build a fully working database system to handle their core business which is concerned with the following areas:
Customer records
Booking Records for Trips
Trips and the components of trips
Vessels
#### Background on how the company organises its work:
Hyde Travel operates holiday breaks in Europe, travelling from the UK to destinations in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Customers make bookings in their own name. They can book places for up to 10 passengers. A particular trip will be made up of several components. Any component, such as a river cruise, could involve a visit to one or more places. A component is usually assigned a vessel (e.g. river ship, train, coach). Some vessels are used on more than one component. Some components use more than one vessel.
#### Please Note: 
The data shown in the case is not necessarily normalised, and that it is the candidateâ€™s task to organise the data in the most optimal way possible. For example, the paper records shown below will not necessarily map directly to database tables. The candidate is expected to use these samples of data as a starting point for their own normalisation and optimisation of Hyde Travel system.
Please Note: the data shown is only examples and represent a fraction of what the entire data set would be for the organisation.
#### Project note:
The raw documents provided have first been normalised to 3rd Normal Form (NF) then further operations have been carried out. 

#### The project contains the following files: 
1) Hyde Travel Database.pdf - unnormalised raw original database (pdf file)
2) Hyde Travel entity listing - final entities post normalisation (png file)
3) Hyde Travel Entity Relation Ship Diagram (ERD) - normalised ERD (png file)
4) Query_Requirements.txt - the queries requested by Hyde Travel (text file)
5) CREATE_statements(hyde_travel_db) - SQL script
6) INSERT_statements(hyde_travel_db) - SQL script
7) SELECT_statements(hyde_travel_db) - SQL script
8) QUERY_statements(hyde_travel_db) - SQL script
9) Final review - documentation of the process (word document)
